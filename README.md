# Polynomial Multiplication of NTRU Prime with AVX2

This repository accompanies with the paper **Technical Report: Even Faster Polynomial Multiplication for NTRU Prime with AVX2**.
Our polynomial multiplication for <tt>ntrulpr761/sntrup761</tt> is 1.77 times faster than the state-of-the-art optimized implementation by
[OpenSSLNTRU: Faster post-quantum TLS key exchange](https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity22/presentation/bernstein).
Folder ``libsntrup`` contains their big-by-big polynomial multiplication and folder ``ntrup`` contains ours.
Please refer to the corresponding folders for instructions.
